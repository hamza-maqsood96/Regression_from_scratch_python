# Linear Regression

I have created linear regression machine learning library from scratch in python.
In this library i make three functions:
- Cost function.
- Gradient function. 
- Gradient decent function.

I have created a random dataset in this library.

## Tools
- Python 
- Numpy 
- Matplotlib 

## Results
With increase of number of iterations cost function is decreasing.
